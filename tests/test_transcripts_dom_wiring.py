"""Guard: static element IDs the Transcripts page script toggles must exist.

A missing element makes ``qs("#id")`` return ``null`` and the first
``.classList`` call throw, silently aborting an entire render/handler flow. That
is exactly what happened when ``#frictionGenerating`` was referenced by
transcripts.js but never added to transcripts.html: the Friction tab showed its
status header (rendered first) but never un-hid its content, and the Re-run
button threw before sending its request.

This is a cheap structural check — it does not exercise behaviour (the project
has no JS DOM harness), but it catches HTML/JS drift for the elements that the
render flow assumes exist.
